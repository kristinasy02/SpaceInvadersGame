# SpaceInvadersGame

//26 January

Update:

Played the game to understand how it works
Created a repo in gitHub - https://github.com/kristinasy02/SpaceInvaders
Researched how to cut couple of images which are in different position in one sprite sheet - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekI7vjkFrGA
Created a project - SpaceInvaders, added the sprite sheet in HTML and cut one character with css
Next Steps:

Link the project with gitHub repo
The invaders - array with five rows(top row-character1, second and third-character2, fourth and fifth-character3)
The whole array will move with animation, each single character will have two states which will be its two images from the sprite sheet which will change an animation

Update:

Still trying to crop the spritesheet in different positions, to get the characters images, tried with cutting of exact part of the image, with setting up the width and the height, with defining a background and its position(left, top),with object fit and position, with transform, clip path etc so my next step is to find out the right way to cut them
